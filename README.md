# Fashion-MNIST-experiments

- Fashion MNIST dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist/data
- Benchmark dashboard : http://fashion-mnist.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/#

Tried and tested :

1. Stacked, deep CNN architectures (~90.5% test acc.)
2. Stacked, deep CNN architectures with dropout, data augmentation or both (~92% test acc.)


To-Do :

1. Usage of SVM loss instead of softmax loss
2. Ensembles of deep CNN models with SVC/kNNs etc.
3. Try application of pre-trained ImageNet models
4. CapsNet implementation on Fashion MNIST
